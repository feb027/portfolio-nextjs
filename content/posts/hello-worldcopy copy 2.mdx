# Building My Developer Portfolio

Welcome to a behind-the-scenes look at how I built this developer portfolio! As a software engineer passionate about modern web development, I wanted to create a space that not only showcases my work but also demonstrates my technical expertise.

## Tech Stack Highlights

My portfolio is built with some of the latest and most powerful web technologies:

- **Next.js 15** with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and maintainable styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations
- **MDX** for writing blog posts like this one

## Key Features

### Terminal-Inspired Design

I chose a terminal-inspired theme to create a unique and memorable experience. The neon accents and monospace fonts give it that authentic developer feel while maintaining modern aesthetics and usability.

### Blog Integration

The blog section you're reading right now is powered by MDX, allowing me to write content with rich markdown formatting while also embedding React components when needed.

### Performance Optimization

Performance was a key consideration throughout development. I've implemented:

- React Server Components where possible
- Image optimization with Next.js
- Efficient route handling
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Lessons Learned

Building this portfolio taught me valuable lessons about:

1. Balancing aesthetics with functionality
2. The importance of responsive design
3. Performance optimization techniques
4. Content management with MDX

## What's Next?

This portfolio is an ongoing project. I plan to:

- Add more interactive features
- Expand the blog section
- Implement dark/light theme switching
- Add more project showcases

Stay tuned for more updates and technical deep-dives into specific features!
